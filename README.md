# Football-prediction-LSTM

This kernel attempts to maximize returns on football games by predicting the result using Deep Learning. First, we will use a simple model with Dense layers and some basic data. Then, we will attempt to improve the results using an LSTM layer and sequential input data.

Some truly creative attempts have been used to predict sporting events. This method will focus on using more conventional match statistics such as goals and points.
